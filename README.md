## Declaration of Strings & Numbers
Putting quotation marks around your declarations is a thing of the past! New technology detects a number or a string and initializes accordingly. So you won‚Äôt be able to add a number to the end of your string now, but you can declare both with the same syntax.
```
var name = string
var uuu = cookie
var numy = 3
```
### ~Ints~ Doubles
Why bother with ints when everything can be expressed as a double? This new coding language only uses doubles for simplicity. (although, there are benefits to having both doubles and ints)


## Print
A fun print statement! Use the keyword `scribblebibble` in order to print a variable, or a number, or string.
```
scribblebibble(your print here)
```

## Loops
Syntax: loop (number of repeats): function
```
loop (4): scribblebibble(‚Äúblue‚Äù)
```

## Math Operation
Do any math operation!* And you can do a math operation and store it into a variable at the same time.
```
var numy = {math} 3+4+6
```
*with up to 3 numbers
